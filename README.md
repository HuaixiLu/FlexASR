FlexASR
========

FlexASR is an AXI-programmable hardware accelerator for attention-based seq-to-seq networks. FlexASR can be configured to accelerate end-to-end RNN, GRU or LSTM models with attention mechanisms. It was designed in Synthesizable SystemC followed by high-level synthesis (HLS) in order to generate RTL.

# Getting Started

## Tool versions and environment setup

C++ simulation and HLS of FlexASR top-level and children modules have been verified to work with the following tool versions:

* `gcc` - 4.9.3 (with C++11)
* `systemc` - 2.3.1
* `boost` - 1.55.0 
* `catapult` - 10.5a

In the cmod/cmod_Makefile, please provide the correct tool installation paths for BOOST_HOME, SYSTEMC_HOME and CATAPULT_HOME 

## Directory structure

* `cmod/include/*.h` contains header files for functions and classes from FlexASR
* `cmod/<module>` sub-directories contain FlexASR SystemC modules
* `matchlib` library of synthesizable hardware components from NVIDIA

## Build and run

### C++ compile and simulation of SystemC module

The following commands run C++ compilation and simulation of the FlexASR accelerator top-level, executing 4 LSTM timesteps.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/harvard-acc/FlexASR.git
    cd cmod/Top
    make
    make run
